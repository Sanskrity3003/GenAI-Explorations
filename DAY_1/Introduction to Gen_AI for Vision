## What is AI?
When Human Intelligence is induced in machines, especially in computer systems it is said to be AI.

```
- Stacks are used in ML models
- Neural Network are used in DL Model

Deep Learning was brought when ML Models were not able to train on large datasets. The larger the data given the better the DL Model performs.


## Discriminative VS Generative AI
- Discriminative Ai is used in classification , regression etc.
- d


### The main motive of Generative AI is generation, but it can also perform a few tasks of classification.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Designing input query(prompt) to provide optimized(*low cost*) and quality output for AI models.
- Domain knowledge is very important for prompt engineering.

INPUT  ---------> MODEL -----------> OUTPUT

## Language Model(LLM) VS Vision Model

| Language Model (LLM)                                                              | Vision Models                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Works with text data.                                                           | - Works with image/video data.                                                           |
| - Has Transformer Architechture.<br>(designed  for seq-to-seq task and text data) | - Has Convolutional Neural Network Architechture.<br>(designed specially for image data) |
| - Used in text generation, summarization etc.                                     | - Used in Image and Video generation, image recognition, object detection etc.           |
| - Extension of NLP                                                                | - Extenssion of Co,puter Vision (CV).                                                    |
| eg:- GPT, BERT                                                                    | eg:- Dffusion Model                                                                      |

## What is Image generation model?
These type of model takes in data in the form of text, image, video, noise etc. and then generates a new image accordingly.

INPUT(text, image, noise etc.)------------> IMAGE GENERATION MODEL -------------> OUTPUT

### Conditional Image Generation
Takes input data as text, image, noise and generates conditional images as output accordingly

- Here noise is used because the model generates the output one the basis of noise and conditional input provided.

### Unconditional Image Generation
The model takes in input in the form of noise and generates images.
1. GAN : Generative adversarial network 
2. DDPM : Denoising Diffusion Probablistic model
NOISE-------> IMAGE GENERATION MODEL ---------> OUTPUT IMAGE


# Some popular Vision Model
